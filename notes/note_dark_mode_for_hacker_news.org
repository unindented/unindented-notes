In the [[https://ublockorigin.com/][uBlock Origin]] settings, under /My filters/, you can add a filter that inverts the colors of the page:

#+caption: I lowered the inversion amount from 100% to 90% because the resulting colors were too harsh for me, but feel free to play with different values.
#+begin_src text
news.ycombinator.com##html:style(filter: invert(90%) hue-rotate(180deg); background: white)
#+end_src

This is the result:

#+attr_html: :alt Screenshot of the front page of Hacker News. The header has white text on an orange background, and the body has white and gray text on an almost-black background.
