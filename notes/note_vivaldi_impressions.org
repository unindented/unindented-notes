I tried version 6.8 of [[id:b883de17-f6ed-4eda-9f4d-c336fbd7789f][Vivaldi]] on macOS.

* What I liked

- Ad and tracker blocking can be turned on during the onboarding flow.

- Built-in RSS reader makes it easy to discover and subscribe to feeds. You can preview a feed before subscribing:

* What I didn't like

- Laggy UI animations.

- Bing as default search engine. If you switch to Google, they try to nudge you towards one of their partner search engines.

  #+attr_html: :alt Screenshot of a web browser's start page. At the top there's a callout asking the user to choose a partner search engine to help support the company. There's an open drop-down list with four options: Bing, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, and Startpage.com.

- Start page that shows sponsored bookmarks by default.

  #+attr_html: :alt Screenshot of a web browser's start page. Below a search box there's a grid of bookmarks, including Vivaldi Social, Vivaldi Community, Amazon, Booking.com, Yelp, eBay, Walmart, and others.

- Search bar that shows sponsored URLs by default.

  #+attr_html: :alt Screenshot of a web browser. The user has typed letter 'M' in the address bar, and it has been auto-completed to Macys.com. There's an open drop-down list below the address bar, with an option group at the top that says 'Best Result (Direct Match)', and an option for Macys.com with a pill on the right that says 'Direct Match'.

* Business model

They wrote about their business model on their blog: [[https://vivaldi.com/blog/vivaldi-business-model/][What's Vivaldi's business model?]]

- Partner deals with search engines.
- Sponsored bookmarks on start page.
- Sponsored URLs in any of the browser's search fields.
