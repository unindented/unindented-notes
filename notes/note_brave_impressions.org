I tried version 1.67 of [[id:ecd5b620-bb38-4eaf-b2ed-b63f59814f6d][Brave]] on macOS.

* What I liked

- Ad and tracker blocking turned on by default.

- [[https://brave.com/search/][Brave Search]] is pretty decent.

* What I didn't like

- Start page and URL bar promote quite prominently [[https://brave.com/brave-rewards/][an ad-viewing rewards program]].

  #+attr_html: :alt Screenshot of a web browser's start page. There's a panel on the right promoting Brave Rewards.

- Other parts of the UI promote [[https://brave.com/leo/][an AI assistant]], [[https://brave.com/wallet/][a crypto wallet]], [[https://brave.com/firewall-vpn/][a VPN]], [[https://brave.com/talk/][a video-conferencing product]], [[https://brave.com/brave-news/][an ad-supported news feed]]... I think they're only missing a shopping feature like [[https://www.microsoft.com/edge/shopping][Edge's]]. ðŸ˜¬

  #+attr_html: :alt Screenshot of a web browser's start page. There's a panel on the left promoting Leo, an AI assistant, and a popover on the right promoting Brave Wallet.

* Business model

They explain how they make money in their FAQ: [[https://brave.com/faq/#how-brave-makes-money][How does Brave make money?]]

- Sale of start page takeovers and [[https://brave.com/brave-ads/][Brave Ads]].
- Subscriptions to [[https://brave.com/firewall-vpn/][Brave Firewall + VPN]] and [[https://brave.com/talk/][Brave Talk Premium]].
- Transaction fees in [[https://brave.com/wallet/][Brave Wallet]] and [[https://brave.com/brave-rewards/][Brave Rewards]].
- Partner deals. (They mention platform integrations, but don't specify further.)
