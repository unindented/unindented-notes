* Steam ran =rm -rf /*=

Here's [[https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/3671][the bug report on GitHub]]. The issue is caused by this bit of code:

#+begin_src shell
STEAMROOT="$(cd "${0%/*}" && echo $PWD)"
rm -rf "$STEAMROOT/"*
#+end_src

If =$STEAMROOT= ends up evaluating to an empty string, the command becomes =rm -rf "/"*=.

* Bumblebee ran =rm -rf /usr=

Here's [[https://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee-Old-and-abbandoned/issues/123][the bug report on GitHub]]. The issue is caused by an extra space:

#+begin_src shell
rm -rf /usr /lib/nvidia-current/xorg/xorg
#+end_src
