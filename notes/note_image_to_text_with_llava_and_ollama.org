Sometimes I have trouble writing alt text for images, because I don't know where to start, or how to phrase things, or whatever. I've found that [[https://llava-vl.github.io/][LLaVA]] is good enough to get me going.

I run it via [[id:345a9620-386d-4f15-a633-3056f197f3c8][Ollama]], like this:

#+begin_src text
ollama run llava:13b "describe this image concisely: ./some_image.png"
#+end_src

For example, for this image:

#+attr_html: :width 400 :height 300
#+attr_html: :alt Illustration with three cartoon characters. On the left is a female character with her hand on her hip. In the center is the same female character with the same pose, but with no face. On the right is a black silhouette of a male character.
#+caption: Concept art of characters in [[https://studio.blender.org/films/coffee-run/][Coffee Run]], by [[https://studio.blender.org/][Blender Studio]].
[[./note_demo_image_small@2x.png]]

I got the following, which is a decent starting point:

#+begin_quote
The image shows a digital illustration of three characters. On the left, there is a female character with blue hair and casual attire, displaying a confident stance with her hands on her hips. In the center, another similar female character is depicted, also with blue hair but wearing a tank top instead of a shirt. To the right, there is an outline of a male figure with no visible features or clothing, suggesting his form is not fully visible in the illustration. The background is dark with a purple hue, providing a stark contrast to the characters.
