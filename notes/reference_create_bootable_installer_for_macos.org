* Creating a bootable USB

- Download a full macOS installer from the App Store.
- Connect a 32GB or larger USB drive.
- Run the following command from a terminal (replacing =/Volumes/Untitled= with the path to your USB drive):

#+begin_src
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sonoma.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --nointeraction
#+end_src

* Booting from the USB

If you're on Apple silicon, do the following:

1. Turn off the device.
2. Connect the USB drive.
3. Press and hold the power button until you see the startup options screen.

If you're on Intel silicon, do this instead::

1. Turn off or restart the device.
2. Connect the USB drive.
3. Press and hold ~‚å• Option~ or ~Alt~ until you see the startup manager.
